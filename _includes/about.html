            <p class="paragraph-text justify-text">
                I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Mathematics at The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa. 
I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Kyungyong Lee. 
Before coming to Rice, I earned a Master's degree in Statistics at Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan.

I often describe myself as "50% statistician, 30% mathematician and 20% computer scientist". 
Part of my research focuses on the use of statistical/mathematical models (e.g. branching process) to model population dynamics in biology. 
One example is the progression of cancer cells in malignant tumors. 
I am also interested in the combination of modern statistical and computational tools to tackle "big data" problems in biomedical science. 
I am developing a Bayesian semi-parametric joint model, capable of modeling multiple primary cancers as well as competing risks from multiple cancer types, for accurate personalized cancer risk prediction.
