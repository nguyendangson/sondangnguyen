            <p class="paragraph-text justify-text">
                I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Mathematics at The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa. 
I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. <a href="https://math.ua.edu/people/klee/">Kyungyong Lee</a>.
Before coming to Alabama, I earned a Master's degree in Optimization and Statistics at Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan.

            <p class="paragraph-text justify-text">
My research focuses on combinatorial problems related to Lie Theory and Representation Theory, especially Quiver Represetation and Cluster Algebras.
	I also love Invariant Theory, Geodesic Optimization and Orbit-Closure-Separation problems which surprisingly very closed to P and NP problem, 
		    Matrix Scaling, Tensor problems, and Maximum Likelihood Estimation in Tensor Normal Models in pure Computer Science (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOnyful_oPY&ab_channel=InternationalMathematicalUnion">Avi Wigderson ICM talk</a>).
