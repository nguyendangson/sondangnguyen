                I am currently a third-year PhD student in Statistics at Rice University. 
I am fortunate to be jointly advised by Prof. Marek Kimmel from Rice and Dr. Wenyi Wang from MD Anderson Cancer Center. 
Before coming to Rice, I spent a few years in the UK, working towards my BSc Mathematics at Imperial College London and my MPhil Finance at University of Cambridge.

I often describe myself as "50% statistician, 30% mathematician and 20% computer scientist". 
Part of my research focuses on the use of statistical/mathematical models (e.g. branching process) to model population dynamics in biology. 
One example is the progression of cancer cells in malignant tumors. 
I am also interested in the combination of modern statistical and computational tools to tackle "big data" problems in biomedical science. 
For example, I am developing a Bayesian semiparametric joint model, capable of modeling multiple primary cancers as well as competing risks from multiple cancer types, for accurate personalized cancer risk prediction.

                Favorite mathematicians: I particularly admire Sir. Isaac Newton for setting up the foundation of Mathematics (i.e. calculus), and his contributions to science in general (e.g. the three laws of motion). 
Leonhard Euler is also a hero of mine, mainly for his prolific scientific contributions and his will to overcome physical handicaps. 
In modern days, Stephen Hawking is an inspiration to me!!!

                I enjoy watching movies in my free time. Some of my favorites are The Shawshank Redemption, Memoirs of a Geisha, and the Dark Knight trilogy. 
I like traveling, with Japan and Korea being at the top of my list. I want to add a few destinations in Europe to the list when I have time.
